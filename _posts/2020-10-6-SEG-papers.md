## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/){:target="\_blank"} engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.


This is the collection of interesting paper I read from [SEG conference](https://seg.org/AM/2020/) abstracts published online.

## papers
1. [Geophysical data and gradient translation using deep neural networks](../../../assets/blog/20201006/Geophysical data and gradient translation using deep neural networks.pdf)

2. [Full-waveform inversion of transmitted ultrasound to image the human brain](../../../assets/blog/20201006/Full-waveform inversion of transmitted ultrasound to image the human brain.pdf) [`link`](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0240-8)

    A paper discusses the application of FWI to the imaging of human brain. One of the author ([Michael Warner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TT2V92IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)) proposed the [anisitoric FWI](https://library.seg.org/doi/full/10.1190/geo2012-0338.1) in 2013.
